Constructing arbitrary boolean circuits with IEEE-754 floating point subtraction. Inspired by [this beautiful blog post](https://orlp.net/blog/subtraction-is-functionally-complete/).


## Current logic gates

* AND

* NAND

* OR

* NOR

* XOR

* NOT

Following the blog post, $True \triangleq +0.0$ and $False \triangleq -0.0$

A new type is defined to differentiate between our "Boolean" values and just a normal f32 or f64. Since we only really need +0.0 and -0.0, an f32 sufficied.

Sub defines the Fbit, our floating point booleans, as a simple type alliase for an f32.

```Rust

type Fbit = f32;
```

to check if two Fbits are equal it does not suffice to use the equality operator since

```Rust
assert_eq!(0.0, -0.0); // this does not panic!!!
```

for this you have to use the fbit_eq macro

```Rust
assert!(fbit_eq!(TRUE, TRUE));
assert!(fbit_eq!(FALSE, FALSE));
assert_ne!(fbit_eq!(TRUE, FALSE));
assert_ne!(fbit_eq!(FALSE, TRUE));
```

To negate an Fbit,

```Rust
assert!(fbit_eq!(not(FALSE), TRUE));
```

the basic logic gates can be strung together to create arbitrary boolean functions.

For example, to construct a full 1-bit adder:

```Rust
use sub_rs::*;

fn full_1bit_adder(a: Fbit, b: Fbit. c: Fbit) -> (Fbit, Fbit) {
    (
        xor(xor(a,b), c),
        or(
            and(xor(a,b), c),
            and(a,b)
        )
    )
}

fn main() {
    // add 1 and 1 with 0 for the initial carry bit
    let (s,c) = full_1bit_adder(TRUE. TRUE, FALSE) // (FALSE, TRUE)
}
```

## testing

simply run

```console
> cargo test
```

this will test that the truth tables for the implemented IEEE logic gates are correct.
